# Codeforces Data Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project that examines user behavior and patterns on Codeforces, focusing on identifying trends, anomalies, and insights in competitive programming.

## üìä Analysis Focus

This project performs in-depth analysis of Codeforces data, including:

### User Behavior Analysis
- User rating distribution and progression patterns
- Activity patterns based on geography and organizations
- Performance metrics across different programming competitions
- Participation trends over time

### Competitive Analysis
- Rating distribution across different regions and organizations
- Performance comparison between different user groups
- Success metrics for various programming languages and problem categories

### Data-Driven Insights
- Identification of key performance indicators (KPIs) for competitive programmers
- Analysis of contest participation and its correlation with performance
- Time-series analysis of user activity and performance metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Collection
- Asynchronous data collection from Codeforces API
- Efficient batching of API requests to handle rate limits
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

### Data Processing
- Data cleaning and transformation pipelines
- Feature engineering for analytical metrics
- Efficient storage and retrieval of processed data

### Analysis Tools
- Python-based data analysis stack (pandas, numpy)
- Statistical analysis and visualization
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis

## üìà Key Metrics and Visualizations

- User rating distributions and histograms
- Performance trends over time
- Geographic heatmaps of user activity
- Correlation matrices of different performance metrics
- Time-series analysis of contest participation
